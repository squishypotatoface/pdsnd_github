### Project Title
## Nellys Liang's Data Science Project: Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project is my final project required to pass the Udacity Data Science course.  
The project is a program that utilizes 3 data tables to gather customized information about bikeshare usage:  
• user will be able to customize bikeshare user information from 3 cities: Chicago, New York, City, Washington   
• user must use Python to run the file, by running `$ python3 NL_bikeshare.py`

### Files used
• NL_bikeshare.py
the following files are too large to push to the main repo, but are needed to run the program:
• chicago.csv
• new_york_city.csv
• washington.csv
